# Twitter Analysis

We analyze the behavior of the danish politicians on Twitter up to the Danish General Election in 2019. 

For this purpose we did the following:

1. We created a network-model in order to investigate inter- and intra party engagements on Twitter. We find evidence that Twitter serve as an echo-champer as    politicians mainly engage with politicans from their own or similar parties.

2. We create a bi-gram of word to determine which subject were discussed in the given time-frame of the analysis.

3. We carried out a sentiment analysis to determine how the respective parties communicate on Twitter.

4. We crated a machine learning model predicting the number of likes a Tweet will get.
